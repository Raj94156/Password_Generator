This is the basic password generator code which i have created during my python learning journey

Toughness Level: Beginner (easy)

Concept require:
1.Random module
2.list
3.for loop
4.if loop
5.suffle function of the random 

starting codes which you can copy from below and starting your code with your own logic:
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

print("Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!")
print('Do you want to have the "Easy" Or "Hard" password: Type "Hard" for Hard Password and "Easy" for Easy Password:')
choose = input("So,What you have decided").lower()
nr_letters= int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n")) 
nr_symbols = int(input(f"How many symbols would you like?\n"))
nr_numbers = int(input(f"How many numbers would you like?\n"))

I HAVE LEARN THIS SO YOU ALSO CAN DO ,PLEASE TRY BEFORE DIRECTLY LOOKING TO MY CODE
